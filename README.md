CREATE TABLE Categories (
    category_id VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    category_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);
Competitions:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Competitions (
    competition_id VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    competition_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    parent_id VARCHAR(50),
    type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    gender VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    category_id VARCHAR(50),
    FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES Categories(category_id)
);
Complexes:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Complexes (
    complex_id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    complex_name VARCHAR(255)
);
Venues:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Venues (
    id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    city_name VARCHAR(255),
    country_name VARCHAR(255),
    country_code VARCHAR(10),
    timezone VARCHAR(50),
    complex_id VARCHAR(255),
    FOREIGN KEY (complex_id) REFERENCES Complexes(complex_id)
);
Ensure that these tables have been populated with sample data.
